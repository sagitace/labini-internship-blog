          This entry covers the three days that we spent working on Java
          programming language. We did not spend much time at the DICT office
          because there were frequent brownouts in Legazpi City. We only go to
          DICT every morning and then work from home for the rest of the time.
          Engr. Bonganay told us to continue working on the programming problems
          he gave us last day. The problems ranged from simple to complex and
          covered various topics such as variables, operators, array, and loops.
          The problems were not easy but we managed to solve most of them. This
          also served as a preparation for the diagnostic exam that we will take
          this March 20, 2024.

          Today is different. We could not attend the flag ceremony with the
          other employees this monday because they asked us to move to another
          room. The reason was that there was a training session happening in
          the room where we usually work. Our OJT coordinator, Dr. Rommel Evan
          Paje, informed us that he would come to see us in the afternoon. Engr.
          Bonganay, told us that we could leave early because the room we moved
          to was too small for all of us. However, he also gave us an assignment
          to read and do the exercises from a book about Java Programming
          language by Y. Daniel Liang. He specifically told us to focus on
          chapter 3 and 5 activities, which involved making flowcharts and
          coding. Some of the interns from BU Polangui and CATSU decided to go
          home early, but my team stayed because we will meet our OJT
          coordinator. After some of the interns left, Engr. Bonganay gave us
          more programming problems to solve. He wanted us to figure out the
          output of the problems, just like the previous activities we did.

          We didn't do much today since Engr. Bonganay is not around. As usual,
          I focused on my C++ course. I just read module 3. Later on, some DICT
          staff informed us that DICT region V will be hosting the Flag Raising
          Ceremony on March 11. Interestingly, they mentioned that we would be
          included in the video, and they initially planned to start recording
          in the afternoon. However, they weren't able to record in the
          afternoon, I don't know the reason why. Looking ahead, my team was
          informed that starting tomorrow until Friday, we'll be transitioning
          to a Work from Home setup. The reason behind this change is that some
          interns and work immersion students will be undergoing Digital
          Literacy Training on-site. We already completed this training during
          our first and second weeks. They told us that we will be making a

          It's Monday, and we started the day with an online flag-raising
          ceremonday, which happens every monday of the week. As usual, the
          ceremony is done together with other DICT regions nationwide. Today is
          also the first day for the work immersion students from Legazpi City
          Science High School. Sir Aljhune Morga, a Program Developer Officer
          II, took the time to discuss the basics of ICT (Information and
          Communication Technologt). This was particularly for the immersion
          students, so I focused on taking the module 2 quiz. Each module has
          two quizzes, and I already finished the other one yesterday. Today's
          quiz had 20 items, and I'm happy that I passed it on my first attemp.
          The immersion students also got to learn about productivity tools like
          MS Word, MS Excel, and MS PowerPoint. Later in the day, Engr. Bonganay
          gave us three programming problems to solve. He noticed that we
          weren't very busy, so he wanted to keep us engaged. The problems are
          not that hard, so I feel confident about my answers.

          Our day was a bit different today because Engr. Bonganay had an
          important matter to attend to, so we didn't have our usual activities.
          He let us know yesterday that he wouldn't be arount today, and he
          mentioned that someone else would come to teach us something. However,
          as the day went on, no one showed up. In the meantime, I took the
          opportunity to complete Module 2 of my C++ course on NetAcad. This
          module is a part of the course Engr. Bonganay assigned to us last
          week. It covered topics in C++ programming like loops, bitwise
          operators, and modulo.

          Our day began by continuing the programming exercises from yesterday,
          and we finish it this day. Additionally, Engr. Bonganay introduced a
          new topic - freelancing. He played a pre-recorded workshop from 2020
          and 2021, emphasizing its importance as we might explore freelance
          jobs after graduating or gaining experience in the tech industry. The
          video covered basics and client handling in freelancing.
          <br />
          Another pre-recorded session focused on e-commerce, website
          development, and hosting using wordpress. While I already have
          experience in building en e-commerce website and hosting (using shared
          hosting and VPS), I personally don't prefer using WordPress for
          complex websites. I've come across websires built with WordPress, and
          I don't find them appealing. That sums up our activities for the day.

          challenges, trying to figure out the correct outputs. Surprisingly, we
          got dismissed early at 3:00 PM. We were told that DICT had a memo
          saying that working hours were only until 3:00 PM due to Valentine's
          Day. Adding to the excitement, my team planned to go to Bicol

          expored various Software Development Life Cycles (SDLCs). The workshop
          highlighted the different examples of SDLC like Waterfall Model,
          Agile, Incremental Modal, and more. The video explains how the SDLCs
          guide developers through the stages of requirement analysis, planning,
          design, development, testing, and deployment to ensure high-quality
          software creation. The video also elaborated on the key aspects of
          software quality, emphasizing the importance of Correctness,
          Reliability, Usability, and Maintainability. These aspects are
          critical for ensuring that software not only meets user expectations
          but also maintains performance across different platforms.
          Furthermore, Engr. Bonganay has enrolled us in a NetAcad course on the
          C++ programming language. This course is designed to introduce the
          syntax, basics to advance c++. Based on the NetAcad website, we have
          to finish this course before March 31, 2024.

          and discussion led by Engr. Kim Abarientos, who shared with us some
          tips and best practices on how to protect ourselves and our data
          online. Next, we learned about the PNPKI - Philippine National Public
          Key Infrastructure, which is a system that enables the safe and secure
          exchange of data using digital certificates and signatures. We also
          watched a PKI promotion presentation that explained the benefits and
          features of this system. After that, we polished our poster design
          using Canva. We applied some feedback and suggestions that we received

          Another digital literacy training session today. We learned how to use
          Excel for various tasks, such as creating charts, tables, and
          formulas. Engr. Antonio P. Bonganay guided us through some exercises
          to practice our skills. Next, we used Canva, an online tool for
          graphic design, to make posters for our projects. We already had some
          experience with Canva, so this was not too difficult. Finally, we were
          introduced to Java, a programming language that can be used for web
          development, mobile applications, and more. We took a practice test to
          check our understanding of the basic concepts.
