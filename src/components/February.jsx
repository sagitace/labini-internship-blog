          Yesterday marked the completion of our digital literacy training. This
          day, Engr. Bonganay showed us a pre-recorded workshop video that
          expored various Software Development Life Cycles (SDLCs). The workshop
          highlighted the different examples of SDLC like Waterfall Model,
          Agile, Incremental Modal, and more. The video explains how the SDLCs
          guide developers through the stages of requirement analysis, planning,
          design, development, testing, and deployment to ensure high-quality
          software creation. The video also elaborated on the key aspects of
          software quality, emphasizing the importance of Correctness,
          Reliability, Usability, and Maintainability. These aspects are
          critical for ensuring that software not only meets user expectations
          but also maintains performance across different platforms.
          Furthermore, Engr. Bonganay has enrolled us in a NetAcad course on the
          C++ programming language. This course is designed to introduce the
          syntax, basics to advance c++. Based on the NetAcad website, we have
          to finish this course before March 31, 2024.

          The End of our Dital Literacy Training. This day was the last day of
          our digital literacy training. We polished all our exercises in MS
          Word, MS Excel, and MS PowerPoint. We finally Graduated! We took some
          pictures together, but we did not receive our certificates yet, as
          they were not signed by the DICT Director. We were told that they will
          just give it to us after it is signed. I am grateful for this
          opportunity to learn digital literacy skills, although I already have
          knowledge about it, this helps me improved my skills.

          We attended another digital literacy training seasion where we learned
          how to use pivot tables in MS Excel. This is a powerful tool that can
          help us analyze and summarize data in a simple way. Engr. Antonio B.
          Bonganay explained the basics of pivot tables, such as how to create
          them, filter, and sort data. He also showed us some examples for us to
          understand it well. He gave us exercises 12 and 13, this involved
          creating pivot tables. We learned how to apply different dunctions,
          such as sum, average, etc., to the data fields.

          This day of my internship was a busy and productive one. We started
          the morning by participating in the flag ceremony with the other
          employees and interns. Then, we continued with the digital literacy
          training, where we learned how to use mail merge in MS Word. It is a
          useful skill to create personalized letters and documents for
          different recipients. We also got to meet some new interns. In the
          afternoon, we took the ECDL/ICDL word processing pre-test sample to
          assess our knowledge and skills. Finally, we had an orientation
          session with Engr. Antonio B. Bonganay, discussed about the mission
          and vision of DICT, and goals of the department, as well as the
          different programs that they are implementing.

          On Day 4 of the Digital Literacy Training, we had several activities
          that enhanced our knowledge and skills on cyber security and data
          transmission. First, we attended a cyber attack awareness presentation
          and discussion led by Engr. Kim Abarientos, who shared with us some
          tips and best practices on how to protect ourselves and our data
          online. Next, we learned about the PNPKI - Philippine National Public
          Key Infrastructure, which is a system that enables the safe and secure
          exchange of data using digital certificates and signatures. We also
          watched a PKI promotion presentation that explained the benefits and
          features of this system. After that, we polished our poster design
          using Canva. We applied some feedback and suggestions that we received
          from our peers on Day 3. Finally, we continued our Powerpoint activity
          from the previous day, where we practiced creating effective and
          engaging slides using different layouts and slide master.

          Another digital literacy training session today. We learned how to use
          Excel for various tasks, such as creating charts, tables, and
          formulas. Engr. Antonio P. Bonganay guided us through some exercises
          to practice our skills. Next, we used Canva, an online tool for
          graphic design, to make posters for our projects. We already had some
          experience with Canva, so this was not too difficult. Finally, we were
          introduced to Java, a programming language that can be used for web
          development, mobile applications, and more. We took a practice test to
          check our understanding of the basic concepts.
