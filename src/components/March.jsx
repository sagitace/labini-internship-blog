          Today, we were instructed to relocate to another room as our usual
          space was reserved for a training session about the e-gov app.
          Unfortunately, Engr. Bonganay is still unavailable. My team were
          assigned the task of inputting product specifications from the Google
          sheet provided by Ma'am Michelle Bartolome. Additionally, I received a
          Quotation Sheet to deliver to Jebson, containing a list of materials
          required by DICT, such as bond papers, scissors, etc. I then go
          outside and handed over the sheet to Jebson. Jebson was not that far
          from DICT. As the day progressed, we were informed that due to a
          scheduled day-long power outage in Legazpi City, we would be working
          from home (WFH) the next day. On the 26th day, they didn't give us
          something to work on, so I utilized the time to prepare for an
          upcoming diagnostic exam.

          Engr. Bonganay was not around, but despite his absence, he provided us
          with a new set of programming exercises to delve into. These are Java
          programming exercises. We have to get the output of the problems. The
          problems are not that hard, just by reading the codes, I can already
          predict its output without writing down the solution. In the
          afternoon, Ma'am Shane Manlapaz led a comprehensive discussion about
          Market Research. She told us that market research is very important
          work in DICT, she emphasize the need for us to know how market
          research is conducted. The discussion delve into the processes of
          budget planning and the creation of essential documets like the
          quotation sheets, purchase request, purchase order, and more. Market
          research is done to ensure the success and effectiveness of an event
          or seminar. The following day, we finished working on the Java
          Programming exercises assigned to us by Engr. Bonganay.

          Monday starts with an online flag ceremony. After the ceremony, Engr.
          Bonganay handed back our papers from the previous weeks, which were
          filled with programming problems we had worked on. Engr. Bonganay took
          the lead by solving the problems himself. Then, he let us go through
          our papers to see if we got the answers right or not. After the
          checking, we approached Engr. Bonganay to request permission to leave
          in the afternoon. The reason was that we needed to go to Bicol
          University main campus to complete and pass the requirements for our
          On-the-Job Training (OJT). Engr. Bonganay agreed to our request, but
          he emphasized that we must provide him with an excuse letter before
          leaving.

          Today, Engr. Bonganay played a pre-recorded video that he had prepared
          for the senior high school students who are undergoing working
          immersion. The video explained some concepts of the Python Programming
          Language, including Turple. However, us interns, our main task for the
          day was to work on the Java programming problems that Engr. Bonganay
          had assigned us before. We managed to complete many problems, but some
          of them were quite difficult and we struggled to find the right
          solutions. We spent the whole day doing the task.
